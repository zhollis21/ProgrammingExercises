# Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) is a collection of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. A project Euler problem is a problem that can be solved by writing a program. The problems range from easy to hard and require a good understanding of algorithms and data structures.

This project contains solutions to some of the problems from Project Euler.
